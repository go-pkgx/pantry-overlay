# sshcert-authorize, a static pure-Go program (CGO_ENABLED=0), like the release binaries.
#
# Built in MODULE mode, `go install github.com/go-authn/sshcert/cmd/sshcert-authorize@v{{version}}`, and not with
# `go build` inside the tag tarball. A tarball has no .git, so Go stamps the
# main module as "(devel)": `go version -m` would not name the release, and
# govulncheck and the release workflow's own check (mod == tag) could not
# match the binary to an advisory. In module mode Go records the version and
# the go.sum hash of the exact module it compiled, verified against
# sum.golang.org.
#
# The tag tarball stays the distributable, so the factory attests the source.
# The last build step proves the two are the same tree: every file Go
# compiled is compared byte for byte with the tarball.
#
# No -buildmode=pie (vale.sh adds it on linux for a cgo crash): with cgo off
# it would add a PT_INTERP, and this binary must run with no loader at all.
