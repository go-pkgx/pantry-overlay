# The build toolchain of the sovereign builder image, as a SET.
#
# This was builder/toolchain.txt: one `<pkg>[@version]` per line, a flat list
# outside the recipe format. It could not be versioned, published, installed,
# or depended on by anything. The three systems that solved this — Nix
# buildEnv, Guix manifests, Spack environments — all make the set a
# first-class object, and Nix makes it an ordinary package. So does this.
#
# Every entry keeps the reason it was written with, BELOW it, exactly as the
# text file had it: that is what made the file worth reviewing, and a format
# that lost it would be a step back.
#
# A SET IS UNORDERED, and that is deliberate rather than a limitation. Nix,
# Guix and Spack manifests are all unordered; the order comes out of
# concretisation, not out of the file. `bk closure` resolves this set to the
# same 41 projects as naming its 25 members by hand — verified — differing
# only in sequence, which the topological walk decides.
#
# Which is why seed/order.txt must NOT become a set. That file is a BUILD
# ORDER: inside a dependency cycle the topological order is a guess, and
# order.txt is the hand-tuned guess that works. `bk closure --check-order`
# exists to judge it. A set cannot carry that, and pretending otherwise would
# throw away the tuning the sovereign generation depends on.
#
# builder/toolchain.txt is a different thing — an INSTALL list
# (`pkgm install -s --prefix /usr -f builder/toolchain.txt`), where order
# carries nothing. That is why it is the one that could become a set.

    # PINNED so every architecture stages the SAME
    # headers. That is the invariant; the version is
    # whatever all of them can be given.
    #
    # ~7.2 (major.minor, so 7.2.x only), NOT ^7.2:
    # caret allows minor bumps and would pin nothing.
    #
    # It was ~7.1, and that was a MIRROR's limit wearing
    # the invariant's clothes: dist.pkgx.dev stopped at
    # 7.1.12 for x86-64 while carrying 7.2.x for
    # aarch64, so 7.1 was the newest both could be
    # given. The old note said to lift it "once we
    # build 7.2.x for x86-64 ourselves" — which is what
    # happened here.
    #
    # What forced the question: the s390x lane builds
    # everything itself and therefore holds exactly ONE
    # linux-headers, 7.2.8. The first sovereign s390x
    # build died in 22 seconds with
    # builder: resolve closure: no version of
    # kernel.org/linux-headers satisfies "~7.1"
    # (available: 1)
    # A pin written for a stale mirror had become the
    # thing stopping the architecture that needs no
    # mirror at all.

    # 2. automake's own configure probe. libisl's
    # configure stops at

    # BOTH are needed, and gzip is not optional next to

    # and was written for this (packages#89).
